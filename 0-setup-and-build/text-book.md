Nothing to be done here!
Register Gitlab and get access to https://github.com/ditsing/plain-interpreter-guide.git.

1. Command: git

`$ git add file_one.c file_one.h # Add files to store.`

`$ git add . # Add all files in current director. Make sure not to add binary files.`

`$ git commit  # After adding all files, commit to local git repository.`

2. Command: make

`$ make # build your program and run it.`

`$ make file_one # build your program only.`

`$ make clean # removes compiled binary, handy for git commit.`

Have a look at makefile which tells make how to do its job.
